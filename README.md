## About Me

Software Engineering student focused on building production-ready systems, not just prototypes. I’m deeply interested in AI/ML, backend architecture, and fullstack product delivery. Alongside engineering, I explore startup ideas, validate them through real users, and ship fast with a strong focus on scalability and maintainability. Comfortable with DevOps fundamentals and deployment workflows.

## Active Projects

### YubileykaCRM
Internal CRM platform for an education center, focused on operational automation and backend-controlled business flows.

- Automates student lifecycle management from lead/application intake to group enrollment, attendance tracking, and payment state management.
- Solves fragmented school operations by consolidating scheduling, finance events, and parent communication into one coherent system.
- Built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, and Docker, with API-first integration points for messaging workflows.
- Uses modular backend architecture: domain-separated endpoints, strict validation schemas, and role-based access control by responsibility.
- Includes automation pipelines for attendance notifications, payment reminders, and routine operator tasks to reduce manual overhead.
- Used in real educational operations where reliability, data consistency, and traceability are required across daily workflows.

### YubiRank
Ranking and gamification system that converts educational activity into a measurable XP-based progression model.

- Tracks XP events across attendance, punctuality, activity, and assignments, then calculates rankings and progression levels in real time.
- Solves engagement and retention challenges by making student progress transparent for admins, teachers, students, and parents.
- Implemented with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript, and Docker, with role-specific interfaces and analytics endpoints.
- Built on structured evaluation logic: configurable XP rules, event audit history, and deterministic score recalculation.
- Supports scaling through clean API segmentation, migration-managed schema growth, and import tooling for batch onboarding.
- Operates as a production-facing internal product where performance analytics and controlled access are core system requirements.

## Future Goals

- Build AI-powered systems that solve real business problems.
- Design scalable products with strong backend architecture and clean developer experience.
- Launch and grow technology startups from idea to sustainable execution.
- Keep learning relentlessly across engineering, product, and leadership.
